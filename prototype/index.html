        <h2>The Buffalo National River Region: A Paddler's and Hiker's Paradise</h2>
        <p>The Buffalo National River, established in 1972 as America’s first national river, is a spectacular destination. Its towering limestone bluffs, pristine waters, and accessible gravel bars make it a premier spot for multi-day paddling trips and scenic hiking. Many veteran explorers consider the Buffalo a must-do trip, especially during the spring float season. It’s often said, <strong>"You haven’t truly seen Arkansas until you’ve floated under the towering cliffs of the Buffalo."</strong></p>

        <h3>Key Hiking Trails in the Upper Region</h3>
        <p>The area around Jasper, Arkansas, and Ponca offers incredible access to trails leading to panoramic views. The Lost Valley Trail is a popular beginner-friendly choice, but for endurance athletes preparing for events like the Grand Canyon Rim-to-Rim, more challenging options are available. The primary difficulty in these mountainous areas is often the rapid change in elevation.</p>
